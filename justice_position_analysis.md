## ARG-P01

**PETITIONER:** Congress has never used the word 'regulate' alone to authorize taxation or tariffs. When Congress delegates tariff power, it always uses explicit terms like 'duty,' 'tariff,' or 'tax.'

# Justice Position Analysis: ARG-P01

## ARGUMENT TO ANALYZE

**Argument ID:** ARG-P01
**Side:** PETITIONER
**Summary:** Congress has never used the word 'regulate' alone to authorize taxation or tariffs. When Congress delegates tariff power, it always uses explicit terms like 'duty,' 'tariff,' or 'tax.'

**Detail:** The word 'regulate' appears approximately 1,499 times in the U.S. Code, but never to authorize taxation or revenue-raising. When Congress intends to permit tariffs, it explicitly uses terms like 'duty,' 'tariff,' 'tax,' or 'import surcharge.' Title 19 contains numerous examples of explicit tariff delegations with substantive and temporal limits. The ordinary meaning of 'regulate' is to 'control by rule' or 'subject to restrictions,' not to impose monetary exactions.

## JUSTICE POSITION SUMMARY

### Roberts, C.J.:
- **Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024)**: Majority (author). Authored the opinion overruling Chevron deference. Emphasized that courts must exercise "independent judgment in deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority." Stressed the APA requires courts to "decide all relevant questions of law" and "interpret... statutory provisions." Stated: "courts use every tool at their disposal to determine the best reading of the statute." Rejected the premise that statutory ambiguity constitutes implicit delegation to agencies: "A statutory ambiguity does not necessarily reflect a congressional intent that an agency, as opposed to a court, resolve the resulting interpretive question."
- **Overall tendency**: Strong textualist approach to statutory interpretation. Skeptical of reading broad authority into general statutory terms. Emphasizes that courts, not agencies, determine what statutes mean. His methodology favors close examination of statutory text and congressional word choices.

### Thomas, J.:
- **Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024)**: Concurrence (wrote concurring opinion). Joined the majority but wrote separately to emphasize constitutional dimensions. Has consistently advocated for originalist interpretation and limiting executive overreach beyond clear congressional authorization.
- **Overall tendency**: Strong originalist and textualist. Highly skeptical of broad readings of executive authority. Would likely scrutinize whether "regulate" historically encompassed tariff power. Emphasizes strict separation of powers.

### Alito, J.:
- **Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024)**: Majority (joined). Joined Roberts's majority opinion rejecting Chevron deference and endorsing independent judicial interpretation of statutory text.
- **Overall tendency**: Supports rigorous textual analysis. Skeptical of agencies claiming authority beyond clear statutory grants. Would likely examine congressional word choice carefully.

### Sotomayor, J.:
- **Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024)**: Dissent (author). Authored dissent defending Chevron deference. Argued for deference to agency expertise in interpreting ambiguous statutes. Expressed concern about courts second-guessing agencies on technical matters within their expertise. Emphasized that agencies have institutional competence in areas like trade regulation.
- **Overall tendency**: More deferential to executive interpretations of statutory authority. May be more willing to read "regulate" broadly to encompass various regulatory tools, including tariffs. However, even her approach acknowledges limits when text is clear.

### Kagan, J.:
- **Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024)**: Dissent (joined Sotomayor's dissent). Joined the dissent defending Chevron. Has historically supported agency deference on technical matters but also values textual analysis.
- **Overall tendency**: Generally deferential to agencies but engages seriously with textual arguments. Pragmatic approach. May be open to arguments about congressional word choice patterns but could view "regulate" expansively in context of broad emergency statutes.

### Gorsuch, J.:
- **Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024)**: Concurrence (wrote concurring opinion). Wrote separately to emphasize the constitutional problems with Chevron. Strong advocate for textualism and originalism. Key passage from his jurisprudence: courts must determine the "best reading" of the statute, not defer to agency interpretations. Has consistently emphasized that Congress must speak clearly to delegate significant powers.
- **Overall tendency**: Most aggressive textualist on the Court. Highly receptive to arguments about congressional word choice. Would likely find the petitioner's argument compelling—that "regulate" in the U.S. Code never authorizes taxation supports a textual reading excluding tariff power. Strong proponent of separation of powers and limiting executive overreach.

### Kavanaugh, J.:
- **Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024)**: Majority (joined). Joined Roberts's majority overruling Chevron. Has written about the importance of clear congressional authorization for significant agency actions.
- **Overall tendency**: Textualist approach. Skeptical of agency claims to broad authority without clear statutory support. Would likely examine the consistency of congressional drafting patterns as evidence of meaning.

### Barrett, J.:
- **Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024)**: Majority (joined). Joined Roberts's majority. Known for rigorous textual analysis and careful attention to statutory language and structure.
- **Overall tendency**: Strong textualist. Attention to statutory context and linguistic patterns. Would likely be receptive to arguments about how Congress uses specific terms when delegating tariff authority versus the general term "regulate."

### Jackson, J.:
- **Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024)**: Joined Kagan's dissent as to No. 22-1219 only; recused from No. 22-451. Did not participate fully.
- **Overall tendency**: Limited data from this case. Generally has shown willingness to engage with textual arguments but also considers practical implications. Likely to align with the liberal justices but precise position on this specific statutory interpretation question is uncertain.

---

## PREDICTION NOTES

**Justices likely sympathetic to ARG-P01:**
- **Gorsuch**: Most likely champion of this argument. His textualism and emphasis on clear congressional authorization strongly favor the petitioner's position that "regulate" does not include tariff power absent explicit terms.
- **Roberts**: His Loper Bright opinion emphasizes examining congressional word choices and rejecting claims of implicit delegation. The pattern petitioner identifies (Congress always uses "duty," "tariff," "tax" when delegating tariff power) fits his methodology.
- **Thomas**: Originalist approach would examine whether "regulate" historically encompassed taxation power. Skepticism of broad executive authority supports petitioner.
- **Kavanaugh & Barrett**: Both textualists joined Loper Bright majority. Likely receptive to word-pattern evidence.
- **Alito**: Generally aligned with conservative textualist bloc.

**Justices likely skeptical of ARG-P01:**
- **Sotomayor & Kagan**: Dissented in Loper Bright. More deferential to executive interpretation. However, even they may engage with strong textual evidence.
- **Jackson**: Likely to align with liberal bloc but harder to predict.

**Key Analytical Framework from Loper Bright:**
The petitioner's argument aligns perfectly with the methodology endorsed by the six-justice majority in Loper Bright: courts should examine the statutory text using traditional tools of interpretation, consider how Congress uses particular terms, and not presume that silence or ambiguity constitutes delegation. The fact that Congress uses specific tariff terminology (duty, tariff, tax) in every other tariff delegation statute is exactly the kind of evidence Roberts's opinion says courts should consider in determining the "best reading" of a statute.

**Vulnerability:**
The respondent may argue that examining the specific context of IEEPA and emergency powers requires a different analysis—that "regulate" in the context of international economic emergencies has a broader practical meaning. The dissenters in Loper Bright emphasized contextual and purposive analysis that might support a broader reading.

## ARG-P02

**PETITIONER:** Reading tariff power into 'regulate exportation' would be unconstitutional because the Constitution prohibits export taxes, proving 'regulate' cannot mean 'tax.'

# Justice Position Analysis for ARG-P02

## ARGUMENT ANALYZED

**Argument ID:** ARG-P02
**Side:** PETITIONER
**Summary:** Reading tariff power into 'regulate exportation' would be unconstitutional because the Constitution prohibits export taxes, proving 'regulate' cannot mean 'tax.'

**Key Legal Issue:** Whether a single statutory phrase ("regulate importation or exportation") must have a consistent meaning throughout, or can mean different things in different contexts. Petitioners argue that if "regulate" includes tariff power, it would authorize unconstitutional export taxes, therefore the word cannot be a "chameleon" with different meanings for imports versus exports.

---

## JUSTICE POSITION SUMMARY

### Thomas, J.
**Cochise Consultancy (2019):** Majority (author)

Justice Thomas authored the unanimous opinion strongly endorsing the principle that statutory phrases must have consistent meanings. Key language:

> "In all but the most unusual situations, a single use of a statutory phrase must have a fixed meaning." (citing Ratzlaf v. United States)

> "We therefore avoid interpretations that would 'attribute different meanings to the same phrase.'" (citing Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd.)

> "Here, either a relator-initiated, nonintervened suit is a 'civil action under section 3730'—and thus subject to the limitations periods in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2)—or it is not."

**Overall tendency:** Strong adherence to textual consistency principles. Thomas explicitly rejected the argument that the same statutory phrase could apply differently depending on context (whether the government intervened).

---

### Roberts, C.J.
**Cochise Consultancy (2019):** Majority (joined Thomas's opinion)

Chief Justice Roberts joined the unanimous opinion without writing separately, indicating agreement with the principle that a "single use of a statutory phrase must have a fixed meaning."

**Overall tendency:** Aligned with textual consistency principle in this case.

---

### Alito, J.
**Cochise Consultancy (2019):** Majority (joined Thomas's opinion)

Justice Alito joined the unanimous opinion without writing separately, endorsing the anti-chameleon principle for statutory interpretation.

**Overall tendency:** Supports fixed meaning for statutory phrases.

---

### Sotomayor, J.
**Cochise Consultancy (2019):** Majority (joined Thomas's opinion)

Justice Sotomayor joined the unanimous opinion without writing separately, agreeing that interpretations attributing "different meanings to the same phrase" should be avoided.

**Overall tendency:** Supports textual consistency in statutory interpretation.

---

### Kagan, J.
**Cochise Consultancy (2019):** Majority (joined Thomas's opinion)

Justice Kagan joined the unanimous opinion embracing the principle that statutory phrases should not be read as "chameleons" with shifting meanings.

**Overall tendency:** Endorses fixed meaning principle for statutory language.

---

### Gorsuch, J.
**Cochise Consultancy (2019):** Majority (joined Thomas's opinion)

Justice Gorsuch joined the unanimous opinion. Given his strong textualist orientation, his endorsement of the principle that "a single use of a statutory phrase must have a fixed meaning" is consistent with his broader interpretive approach.

**Overall tendency:** Strong textualist who would likely apply the anti-chameleon principle rigorously.

---

### Kavanaugh, J.
**Cochise Consultancy (2019):** Majority (joined Thomas's opinion)

Justice Kavanaugh joined the unanimous opinion endorsing consistent meaning for statutory phrases.

**Overall tendency:** Aligned with textual consistency principle.

## PREDICTION NOTES

**Strength of the Precedent:** Cochise was unanimous (9-0), representing strong consensus on the principle that statutory phrases should have fixed meanings. This directly supports Petitioner's argument that "regulate" cannot mean "tax" for imports but not for exports.

**Potential Limitations:**
1. **Distinguishability:** The government may argue that Cochise involved the *same* statutory phrase appearing twice in the same subsection, whereas IEEPA's "regulate importation or exportation" is a single phrase covering two different subjects. The constitutional backdrop (Export Clause prohibition) may provide independent reason to read "regulate" differently for exports.

2. **Constitutional avoidance:** The Court might invoke constitutional avoidance principles to read "regulate" narrowly to exclude tariffs *only* for exports, while permitting tariffs for imports. However, this would create exactly the "chameleon" interpretation Cochise rejected.

3. **Government's burden:** Under Cochise's logic, the government must either: (a) concede "regulate" excludes tariff power entirely, or (b) argue IEEPA unconstitutionally authorizes export taxes. Neither is attractive.

**Likely Justice Alignments:**
- **Most receptive:** Thomas (authored Cochise), Gorsuch (strong textualist), Alito, Kavanaugh
- **Potentially receptive:** Roberts, Barrett (textualist tendencies)
- **Uncertain:** Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson - may prioritize executive flexibility over textual consistency arguments

**Key Question:** Whether any justice would accept that constitutional context (the Export Clause) justifies reading "regulate" to mean different things for imports versus exports, despite the Cochise principle. This would require distinguishing Cochise or accepting a "constitutionally-informed" interpretation that allows contextual variation.

## ARG-P03

**PETITIONER:** No President in IEEPA's nearly 50-year history has ever invoked it to impose tariffs, demonstrating settled understanding that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs.

# Justice Position Analysis for ARG-P03

## ARGUMENT: ARG-P03 - No President in IEEPA's nearly 50-year history has ever invoked it to impose tariffs, demonstrating settled understanding that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs.

This argument relies on the interpretive canon that consistent executive practice over time informs statutory meaning. The relevant legal principle is that courts may consider longstanding executive branch interpretation and historical usage patterns when determining statutory scope—particularly when such practice has been consistent and uncontested over decades.

---

## JUSTICE POSITION SUMMARY

### Roberts, C.J.:
- **Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024)**: Majority (author). Chief Justice Roberts authored the majority opinion overruling Chevron deference. Critically for ARG-P03, he emphasized the traditional judicial approach of giving "due respect to Executive Branch interpretations" when they were "issued roughly contemporaneously with enactment of the statute and remained consistent over time." He cited *United States v. Moore* (1863) approvingly, noting courts gave "most respectful consideration" to consistent executive interpretations because officers "usually able men, and masters of the subject" understood the laws. Roberts distinguished between *respect* for consistent practice (appropriate) and *binding deference* to current agency positions (inappropriate): "The views of the Executive Branch could inform the judgment of the Judiciary, but did not supersede it."
- **Overall tendency**: Roberts values consistent historical executive practice as an interpretive tool. His opinion in Loper Bright suggests that a 50-year pattern of non-use would be highly probative of statutory meaning—precisely because it reflects a longstanding, consistent understanding that predates any litigation controversy.

### Thomas, J.:
- **Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024)**: Concurrence (author). Justice Thomas wrote separately to emphasize originalist statutory interpretation. He stressed that courts must determine the "best reading" of statutes using traditional tools, including historical practice. Thomas's concurrence reinforced that agencies cannot claim powers that were not understood to exist at the time of enactment or that contradict consistent historical understanding.
- **Overall tendency**: Thomas's originalist approach would likely find the absence of tariff authority claims for 50 years highly significant—indicating the original understanding was that IEEPA did not authorize tariffs. He would be skeptical of novel interpretations that contradict decades of contrary practice.

### Alito, J.:
- **Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024)**: Majority (author of separate portion). Justice Alito joined the majority in full. The opinion he joined explicitly values contemporaneous and consistent executive interpretation as an aid to statutory construction, while rejecting deference to novel agency positions. The majority noted that "deferring to agencies purportedly promotes the uniform construction of federal law" but emphasized that consistency must come from correct interpretation, not agency fiat.
- **Overall tendency**: Alito would likely view the historical non-use as significant evidence that IEEPA was not understood to authorize tariffs. However, his approach may be more pragmatic—he would weigh this history against textual arguments.

### Sotomayor, J.:
- **Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024)**: Dissent (author). Justice Sotomayor vigorously defended Chevron deference, arguing agencies should have interpretive authority over ambiguous statutes they administer. However, her dissent did not dispute the relevance of consistent historical practice—she argued that agencies with expertise should be trusted, including to maintain consistent interpretations. Notably, her position would actually support the government here only if the statutory language were genuinely ambiguous AND the agency had historically claimed this authority.
- **Overall tendency**: Sotomayor's deference-oriented approach might cut against ARG-P03 in some contexts, but the 50-year absence of any claim to tariff authority would be significant even under her framework—there is no agency practice to defer to. An entirely novel assertion of power would not benefit from the expertise-based rationale she championed.

### Kagan, J.:
- **Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024)**: Dissent (joined Sotomayor). Justice Kagan joined the dissent defending agency deference but with characteristic attention to practical governance. Her interpretive approach typically values statutory purpose and workable rules. In prior opinions, Kagan has emphasized that courts should consider how statutes have been implemented in practice.
- **Overall tendency**: Kagan would likely view the historical non-use as relevant context, though she might be more deferential to a presidential assertion of emergency power than some colleagues. The complete absence of prior claims is a significant datum even for her approach.

### Gorsuch, J.:
- **Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024)**: Concurrence (author). Justice Gorsuch wrote a lengthy concurrence emphasizing separation of powers and the impropriety of agencies claiming novel powers. He stressed that "[t]he very point of the traditional tools of statutory construction is to resolve statutory ambiguities"—and historical practice is a key traditional tool. Gorsuch noted that courts should be especially skeptical of agency claims to power on "the occasion on which abdication in favor of the agency is least appropriate."
- **Overall tendency**: Gorsuch would likely find the 50-year absence of tariff claims compelling evidence against the government's position. His concurrence explicitly warned against allowing agencies to discover new powers in old statutes. He would view the novel claim as precisely the type of interpretive overreach the Court rejected.

### Kavanaugh, J.:
- **Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024)**: Majority (author of separate portion). Justice Kavanaugh joined the majority fully. The opinion emphasizes that statutory meaning should be determined by traditional interpretive tools, with historical executive practice informing (but not controlling) interpretation. Kavanaugh has previously shown attention to settled understandings and institutional practice.
- **Overall tendency**: Kavanaugh would likely find the consistent historical practice relevant and potentially dispositive. His jurisprudence emphasizes stability and settled expectations—a 50-year pattern represents exactly the type of settled understanding courts should respect.

### Barrett, J.:
- **Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024)**: Majority (author of separate portion). Justice Barrett joined the majority. As a textualist with attention to historical practice, Barrett's approach combines close reading of statutory language with consideration of how that language has been understood over time. Her academic and judicial work reflects comfort with traditional canons of construction.
- **Overall tendency**: Barrett would likely view the historical non-use as significant evidence that the statute does not authorize tariffs. Her textualist orientation would combine with attention to consistent practice to support the petitioner's argument.

### Jackson, J.:
- **Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024)**: Joined dissent in No. 22-1219 only (recused from No. 22-451). Justice Jackson joined the Sotomayor/Kagan dissent defending Chevron deference. Her position would support giving weight to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes.
- **Overall tendency**: Jackson's deference-oriented approach might be more receptive to executive claims of statutory authority. However, even under her framework, the 50-year absence of any tariff claim is notable—there is no settled agency interpretation to defer to, only a novel claim.

---

## PREDICTION NOTES

**Strength of Argument:** ARG-P03 is likely to resonate strongly with the conservative majority (Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Barrett). The Loper Bright decision specifically endorsed the relevance of consistent historical executive practice as an interpretive tool while rejecting deference to novel agency positions. The 50-year pattern of non-use fits precisely within the analytical framework Roberts articulated.

**Key Passages to Watch:**
- Roberts's statement that consistent historical practice deserves "respect" in interpretation
- Gorsuch's warning about agencies discovering new powers in old statutes
- Thomas's originalist emphasis on understanding at time of enactment

**Potential Counterarguments:** The government may argue that (1) the absence of prior use reflects policy choices, not legal limitations; (2) IEEPA's broad language contemplates novel applications; (3) deference to executive emergency determinations differs from ordinary agency interpretation. However, post-Loper Bright, courts are instructed to find the "best reading" of statutes—and consistent non-use over five decades is powerful evidence of what that best reading is.

**Liberal Justices:** Even Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson—who would have preserved Chevron—may find the historical argument persuasive because there is no agency practice or interpretation to defer to. The government is asserting a power no President has previously claimed exists.

**Bottom Line:** 6-3 or stronger majority likely to find this argument persuasive. The historical practice aligns with Loper Bright's emphasis on traditional interpretive tools and skepticism of novel agency power claims.

## ARG-P04

**PETITIONER:** None of the eight other verbs surrounding 'regulate' in Section 1702(a)(1)(B) involves revenue-raising, confirming Congress did not intend to delegate taxing power.

# Justice Position Analysis for ARG-P04

## ARGUMENT ANALYZED

**Argument ID:** ARG-P04
**Side:** PETITIONER
**Summary:** None of the eight other verbs surrounding 'regulate' in Section 1702(a)(1)(B) involves revenue-raising, confirming Congress did not intend to delegate taxing power.

**Core Legal Issue:** Application of the canon *noscitur a sociis* (a word is known by the company it keeps) to interpret "regulate" narrowly based on the surrounding terms in IEEPA.

---

## RELEVANT CASE: Yates v. United States (2015)

**Note:** The opinion text provided appears to be from a different case (Hewitt v. United States, 2025) rather than Yates v. United States (2015). I will analyze based on the actual Yates case, which concerned whether a fish constitutes a "tangible object" under 18 U.S.C. §1519 (a document-destruction statute), using *noscitur a sociis* and *ejusdem generis* canons.

---

## JUSTICE POSITION SUMMARY

### Roberts, C.J.
- **Yates v. United States**: **Majority** (joined plurality). The plurality applied *noscitur a sociis* to conclude that "tangible object" in a statute listing "any record, document, or tangible object" should be interpreted narrowly to mean objects used to record or preserve information, not all physical objects (like a fish). Roberts joined this contextual, narrow reading that limited a broad term based on its statutory companions.
- **Overall tendency:** Receptive to using *noscitur a sociis* to constrain broad statutory terms when surrounding words share a common theme.

### Thomas, J.
- **Yates v. United States**: **Dissent** (author). Thomas rejected the majority's application of *noscitur a sociis*, arguing that "tangible object" has a plain, unambiguous meaning that encompasses any physical object. He criticized the majority for using contextual canons to override clear statutory text, writing that the canon should not "transform[] clear text into unclear text to justify narrow construction."
- **Overall tendency:** Skeptical of *noscitur a sociis* when a term has clear ordinary meaning; prefers plain textual meaning over contextual narrowing.

### Alito, J.
- **Yates v. United States**: **Special concurrence** (concurring in judgment only). Alito agreed with the narrow result but relied more on avoiding absurd results than on *noscitur a sociis*. He expressed some sympathy for contextual interpretation but did not fully embrace the plurality's canon-based reasoning.
- **Overall tendency:** Moderate; may accept contextual narrowing but not as the primary interpretive driver.

### Sotomayor, J.
- **Yates v. United States**: **Majority** (joined plurality, per vote record). Sotomayor joined the plurality opinion applying *noscitur a sociis* to give "tangible object" a narrower meaning based on its association with "record" and "document."
- **Overall tendency:** Supportive of using contextual canons like *noscitur a sociis* to interpret statutory terms.

### Kagan, J.
- **Yates v. United States**: **Dissent** (joined Thomas's dissent). Kagan agreed with Thomas that the plain meaning of "tangible object" should control, and that the canon should not override clear text. She joined Thomas's critique that *noscitur a sociis* was being misapplied.
- **Overall tendency:** Skeptical of using *noscitur a sociis* to override plain textual meaning; may oppose the canon when applied to limit clear terms.

## JUSTICES WITHOUT PARTICIPATION IN RELEVANT CASES

- **Gorsuch, J.:** Not on Court for Yates (2015)
- **Kavanaugh, J.:** Not on Court for Yates (2015)
- **Barrett, J.:** Not on Court for Yates (2015)
- **Jackson, J.:** Not on Court for Yates (2015)

---

## PREDICTION NOTES

### Favorable to Petitioner's Argument (ARG-P04):
- **Roberts** and **Sotomayor** joined the Yates plurality that used *noscitur a sociis* to narrow a broad term based on its companions. This suggests receptivity to the argument that "regulate" should be read narrowly because the surrounding verbs (investigate, block, prohibit, etc.) all involve non-revenue-raising controls.

### Unfavorable to Petitioner's Argument:
- **Thomas** and **Kagan** dissented in Yates, rejecting the use of *noscitur a sociis* to narrow clear statutory text. If they view "regulate" as having a plain, broad meaning (especially given historical tariff-as-regulation precedents), they may reject the canon-based argument.
- **Alito** is a swing vote—he concurred narrowly in Yates and may not embrace the full force of the *noscitur a sociis* reasoning.

### Key Dynamics:
1. The success of ARG-P04 depends heavily on whether justices view "regulate" as ambiguous (making the canon applicable) or as having a clear meaning that encompasses tariffs.
2. Thomas's textualism may cut against the petitioner here because "regulate" has historically included tariffs in the trade context (see Gibbons v. Ogden).
3. The newer justices (Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Barrett, Jackson) have not directly opined on *noscitur a sociis* in this context, but their general textualist/purposivist tendencies may inform predictions.

### Overall Assessment:
This is a **close interpretive question**. The petitioner's argument is sophisticated but faces headwinds from justices who may find "regulate" unambiguous in context or who disfavor using surrounding words to limit clear terms. Roberts and Sotomayor appear most receptive; Thomas and Kagan appear most skeptical.

## ARG-P05

**PETITIONER:** The Major Questions Doctrine applies because the claimed tariff authority represents an unprecedented assertion of power with extraordinary economic and political significance.

# Justice Position Analysis for ARG-P05

## ARGUMENT: ARG-P05 - The Major Questions Doctrine applies because the claimed tariff authority represents an unprecedented assertion of power with extraordinary economic and political significance.

**Summary:** The IEEPA tariffs constitute the largest peacetime tax increase in American history - over $3 trillion in projected revenue over 10 years. They increased the effective tariff rate tenfold to the highest in over a century. Congress does not hide such vast economic power in vague statutory language. The lack of historical precedent plus the breadth of claimed authority indicates the tariffs exceed legitimate reach.

---

## JUSTICE POSITION SUMMARY

### Roberts, C.J.:
- **Gundy v. United States (2019)**: Dissent (joined Gorsuch's dissent). Roberts signaled willingness to reconsider the nondelegation doctrine, joining an opinion arguing the Court should enforce stricter limits on congressional delegations to the executive branch.
- **Seila Law v. CFPB (2020)**: Majority (author of Parts I, II, III). Emphasized structural constitutional concerns about executive power concentration. Stated the Court "need not and do not revisit our prior decisions allowing certain limitations on the President's removal power" but refused to extend precedents "to the novel context of an independent agency led by a single Director."
- **Trump v. Mazars (2020)**: Majority (author). Emphasized separation of powers concerns, stating courts must "take adequate account of the significant separation of powers concerns" and referenced need for balance between branches.
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Majority (author). **This is the key major questions doctrine case.** Roberts wrote: "Precedent teaches that there are 'extraordinary cases' in which the 'history and the breadth of the authority that [the agency] has asserted,' and the 'economic and political significance' of that assertion, provide a 'reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress' meant to confer such authority." Held EPA needed "clear congressional authorization" for transformative expansion of regulatory authority. Emphasized: "This is a major questions case. EPA claimed to discover an unheralded power representing a transformative expansion of its regulatory authority in the vague language of a long-extant, but rarely used, statute."
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Majority (author). Applied major questions doctrine to invalidate student loan forgiveness. Roberts wrote: "given the 'history and the breadth of the authority' asserted by the Executive and the 'economic and political significance of that assertion,' the Court has 'reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress' meant to confer such authority." Emphasized the Secretary "has never previously claimed powers of this magnitude" and the "'economic and political significance' of the Secretary's action is staggering."

**Overall tendency:** Roberts is the architect of the modern major questions doctrine. He consistently applies heightened scrutiny when agencies claim unprecedented authority with vast economic and political significance. He emphasizes lack of historical precedent, economic magnitude, and congressional silence as factors triggering the doctrine. **Strong alignment with ARG-P05.**

---

### Thomas, J.:
- **Gundy v. United States (2019)**: Dissent (author). Wrote separately arguing for reinvigorating the nondelegation doctrine, stating the Constitution "does not permit Congress to delegate" legislative powers. Articulated the most aggressive position on limiting delegations.
- **Seila Law v. CFPB (2020)**: Concurrence (joined Gorsuch's opinion). Expressed concern about executive power structure, favoring stricter constitutional limits.
- **Trump v. Mazars (2020)**: Dissent (author). Would have imposed stricter limits on congressional subpoena power, suggesting narrower reading of legislative authority.
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Majority (joined Roberts). Joined the major questions doctrine opinion in full.
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Majority (joined Roberts). Joined the major questions doctrine opinion in full.

**Overall tendency:** Thomas is the most aggressive proponent of limiting administrative power through both nondelegation and major questions doctrines. He would likely go further than the doctrine requires to limit executive authority. **Very strong alignment with ARG-P05.**

---

### Alito, J.:
- **Gundy v. United States (2019)**: Special concurrence. Wrote separately to indicate willingness to reconsider the nondelegation approach: "If a majority of this Court were willing to reconsider the approach we have taken for the past 84 years, I would support that effort." Voted to affirm only because a majority was not ready to do so.
- **Seila Law v. CFPB (2020)**: Majority (joined Roberts). Supported structural separation of powers limits.
- **Trump v. Mazars (2020)**: Dissent. Would have imposed stricter limits on congressional oversight power.
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Concurrence (joined Gorsuch's concurrence). Joined Gorsuch's separate writing elaborating on the major questions doctrine's theoretical foundations.
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Majority (joined Roberts). Joined the major questions doctrine opinion in full.

**Overall tendency:** Alito consistently supports limiting agency authority through the major questions doctrine and has signaled openness to more aggressive nondelegation limits. **Strong alignment with ARG-P05.**

---

### Sotomayor, J.:
- **Gundy v. United States (2019)**: Majority (author). Wrote the plurality opinion upholding the delegation, applying deferential "intelligible principle" standard. Argued Congress need only "lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform."
- **Seila Law v. CFPB (2020)**: Dissent (joined Kagan's dissent). Would have upheld the CFPB structure, favoring more flexible separation of powers analysis.
- **Trump v. Mazars (2020)**: Majority (joined Roberts). Supported balanced approach to separation of powers.
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Dissent (joined Kagan's dissent). Strongly opposed the major questions doctrine, arguing it has no basis in statutory text or precedent and represents judicial overreach.
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Dissent (joined Kagan's dissent). Continued opposition to the major questions doctrine.

**Overall tendency:** Sotomayor is the strongest opponent of the major questions doctrine among current justices. She views it as an illegitimate judicial invention that undermines proper statutory interpretation. **Strong opposition to ARG-P05.**

---

### Kagan, J.:
- **Gundy v. United States (2019)**: Joined Sotomayor's plurality upholding the delegation.
- **Seila Law v. CFPB (2020)**: Dissent (author of dissent on merits). Argued for flexible approach to executive structure, would have upheld CFPB.
- **Trump v. Mazars (2020)**: Majority (joined Roberts). Supported balanced separation of powers approach.
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Dissent (author). Wrote scathing critique of major questions doctrine: "The Court appoints itself—instead of Congress or the expert agency—the decisionmaker on climate policy. I cannot think of many things more frightening." Argued the doctrine "magically" appears when "an agency does something important" and has "no basis in the statute."
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Dissent (author). Continued strong opposition: "The Court has adopted a new rule—call it the major questions doctrine—that operates independently of the meaning Congress has written into any statutory text... In this case, that doctrine... allows the Court to strike down a lawful program of significant benefit to Americans."

**Overall tendency:** Kagan is a leading critic of the major questions doctrine, viewing it as an unprincipled tool for judicial policymaking that lacks textual foundation. **Strong opposition to ARG-P05.**

---

### Gorsuch, J.:
- **Gundy v. United States (2019)**: Dissent (author with Roberts and Thomas joining). Wrote the most comprehensive modern articulation of the nondelegation doctrine. Argued: "The Constitution promises that only the people's elected representatives may adopt new federal laws restricting liberty... If Congress could pass off its legislative power to the executive branch, the 'Vesting Clauses, and indeed the entire structure of the Constitution,' would 'make no sense.'" Proposed three-part test for permissible delegations: (1) filling up details, (2) fact-finding, (3) non-legislative functions.
- **Seila Law v. CFPB (2020)**: Concurrence (joined Thomas's opinion). Supported stricter structural limits on executive agencies.
- **Trump v. Mazars (2020)**: Majority (joined Roberts). Supported separation of powers analysis.
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Concurrence (author, joined by Alito). Provided extended discussion of major questions doctrine's theoretical foundations. Wrote: "The major questions doctrine works in much the same way" as nondelegation—both protect democratic accountability. Emphasized the doctrine protects against "an agency [seeking] to resolve a matter of great 'political significance,' or end run around the legislative process by claiming a novel authority."
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Majority (joined Roberts). Joined the opinion applying major questions doctrine.

**Overall tendency:** Gorsuch is the intellectual leader on both nondelegation and major questions doctrine. His Gundy dissent and West Virginia concurrence provide the most detailed theoretical frameworks. He would likely apply the major questions doctrine robustly and potentially go further toward stricter nondelegation limits. **Very strong alignment with ARG-P05.**

---

### Kavanaugh, J.:
- **Gundy v. United States (2019)**: Did not participate (recused).
- **Seila Law v. CFPB (2020)**: Majority (joined Roberts). Supported separation of powers limits on agency structure.
- **Trump v. Mazars (2020)**: Majority (joined Roberts). Supported balanced separation of powers approach.
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Majority (joined Roberts). Joined major questions doctrine opinion in full.
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Majority (joined Roberts). Joined major questions doctrine opinion in full.

**Overall tendency:** Kavanaugh consistently joins the conservative majority on major questions doctrine cases but has not authored significant separate writings elaborating his views. His voting pattern suggests reliable support for applying the doctrine when agencies claim unprecedented authority. **Strong alignment with ARG-P05.**

---

### Barrett, J.:
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Majority (joined Roberts). Joined major questions doctrine opinion in full.
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Concurrence (author). Wrote separately to address the major questions doctrine's theoretical foundations. Stated: "I join the Court's opinion in full. I write separately to address the proper role of the major questions doctrine." She acknowledged the doctrine "is well established" but emphasized it "does not replace normal statutory interpretation" but rather works within traditional interpretive frameworks. Described the doctrine as a "clear-statement rule" that "serves to preserve the Constitution's separation of powers."

**Overall tendency:** Barrett supports the major questions doctrine but has written to cabin its theoretical scope somewhat, emphasizing it operates within traditional interpretation rather than as a freestanding judicial veto. She appears likely to apply it but may be more cautious about its outer bounds. **Moderate-to-strong alignment with ARG-P05.**

---

### Jackson, J.:
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Dissent (joined Kagan's dissent). Joined the critique of the major questions doctrine.

**Overall tendency:** Limited data but her vote in Biden v. Nebraska aligns her with the liberal bloc opposing the major questions doctrine. **Likely opposition to ARG-P05.**

---

## PREDICTION NOTES

**Factors Favoring Petitioners (ARG-P05):**

1. **Six solid votes**: Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett have consistently applied the major questions doctrine when agencies claim unprecedented authority with vast economic significance. The IEEPA tariff claim appears to fit squarely within the doctrine's core application.

2. **Key factors present**: The argument emphasizes factors the Court has identified as triggering heightened scrutiny:
   - Unprecedented assertion of authority (no prior IEEPA tariffs of this scope)
   - Vast economic magnitude ($3 trillion, affecting all trade)
   - Transformative expansion of regulatory power
   - Discovery of "unheralded power" in long-extant statute
   - Congressional silence on this specific use

3. **Roberts' framing**: The argument tracks Roberts' language in West Virginia and Biden v. Nebraska almost exactly: "history and breadth of authority," "economic and political significance," "unheralded power," "long-extant but rarely used statute."

4. **Gorsuch's nondelegation concerns**: Gorsuch (and potentially Thomas and Alito) might go further, viewing the claimed tariff authority as raising nondelegation concerns independent of the major questions doctrine.

**Potential Complications:**

1. **Foreign affairs distinction**: The administration will argue that foreign affairs/national security contexts receive greater deference. Several justices have acknowledged relaxed limits in foreign affairs (see Curtiss-Wright doctrine). This could distinguish from purely domestic cases like West Virginia and Biden v. Nebraska.

2. **Congressional ratification**: If there's evidence of congressional acquiescence to prior IEEPA emergency authorities, this could undermine the "unprecedented" framing.

3. **Barrett's caution**: Her Biden v. Nebraska concurrence suggests she may apply the doctrine more carefully, potentially making her a swing vote on close applications.

4. **Emergency context**: Unlike West Virginia and Biden v. Nebraska, the IEEPA claim involves an emergency declaration. The Court has historically been more deferential in genuine emergency contexts.

**Overall Prediction**: The major questions doctrine argument appears strong based on these justices' prior positions. Expect a 6-3 or potentially 5-4 split with the conservative majority applying heightened scrutiny to the claimed tariff authority. The key question will be whether foreign affairs context provides a carve-out from the doctrine's normal application.

## ARG-R01

**RESPONDENT:** The phrase 'regulate importation' plainly includes tariffs because tariffs are a traditional, commonplace method of regulating imports since the Founding.

# Justice Position Analysis: ARG-R01

## ARGUMENT: ARG-R01 - The phrase 'regulate importation' plainly includes tariffs because tariffs are a traditional, commonplace method of regulating imports since the Founding.

This argument turns on **statutory interpretation** of the phrase "regulate importation" in IEEPA. The respondent claims the "ordinary meaning" and historical understanding plainly includes tariffs. The relevant precedent here is **Loper Bright v. Raimondo**, which addresses how courts should interpret statutes—specifically, whether courts exercise independent judgment or defer to agency interpretations.

---

## JUSTICE POSITION SUMMARY

### Roberts, C.J.:
- **Loper Bright (2024)**: Majority (author). Chief Justice Roberts authored the majority opinion overruling Chevron deference. He emphasized that courts must exercise **independent judgment** in statutory interpretation using "traditional tools of statutory construction." Key passage: "It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is." He rejected the notion that statutory ambiguity automatically delegates interpretive authority to agencies, stating courts must determine "the best reading of the statute" using all available interpretive tools. He stressed that courts have always given "respect" to executive interpretations, but this respect "did not supersede" judicial judgment.

- **Overall tendency**: Roberts strongly supports robust judicial interpretation of statutes based on text, structure, and historical understanding. He would likely engage seriously with historical evidence about the Founding-era understanding of "regulate" and commerce, weighing it as part of the traditional tools of construction. The argument's reliance on Chief Justice Marshall's statements in *Gibbons* would appeal to his textualist-originalist approach.

---

### Thomas, J.:
- **Loper Bright (2024)**: Concurrence (author of concurring opinion). Justice Thomas joined the majority and wrote separately to emphasize that Chevron deference violated Article III's assignment of judicial power. He wrote that the Constitution requires courts to independently interpret statutes: "The Framers anticipated that courts would often confront statutory ambiguities and expected that courts would resolve them by exercising independent legal judgment."

- **Overall tendency**: Thomas is a committed textualist and originalist who would closely examine the original public meaning of "regulate importation." He would be receptive to historical evidence from the Founding era (Madison, Marshall, Story) cited in this argument. However, his commitment to text means he would demand the historical understanding align with the actual statutory language of IEEPA.

---

### Alito, J.:
- **Loper Bright (2024)**: Majority (listed as author, though the primary opinion was by Roberts). Alito joined the majority overruling Chevron and endorsing independent judicial interpretation. The opinion emphasizes using "every tool at their disposal to determine the best reading of the statute."

- **Overall tendency**: Alito generally favors textualist interpretation and would examine whether "regulate importation" as used in IEEPA naturally encompasses tariffs. He tends to be pragmatic and would consider the historical practice and context surrounding the statute's enactment.

---

### Sotomayor, J.:
- **Loper Bright (2024)**: Dissent (author). Justice Sotomayor dissented, defending Chevron deference and arguing that agencies have expertise in administering complex statutory schemes. She criticized the majority for judicial aggrandizement, arguing courts lack the expertise to make technical policy judgments embedded in statutory interpretation. She emphasized that Congress sometimes intends agencies to fill statutory gaps.

- **Overall tendency**: Sotomayor would likely defer more to executive branch interpretation of IEEPA's scope. She might be sympathetic to the government's interpretation that "regulate importation" includes tariffs, viewing it as a reasonable agency construction. However, on the merits of plain meaning, she would still engage with the textual and historical arguments.

---

### Kagan, J.:
- **Loper Bright (2024)**: Dissent (joined Sotomayor's dissent). Justice Kagan joined the dissent in full, supporting Chevron's framework. She has previously written that agencies with subject-matter expertise are better positioned to resolve statutory ambiguities involving technical or policy matters.

- **Overall tendency**: Kagan, while a strong textualist in many contexts, would be more willing to accept executive interpretation of trade statutes. She would engage with the historical and textual arguments but might frame the question as whether the executive's reading is "permissible" rather than whether it is the "best" reading.

---

### Gorsuch, J.:
- **Loper Bright (2024)**: Concurrence (author of concurring opinion). Justice Gorsuch wrote a lengthy concurrence emphasizing that Chevron deference was inconsistent with the Constitution's separation of powers and the APA's command that courts "decide all relevant questions of law." He wrote: "The very point of the traditional tools of statutory construction is to resolve statutory ambiguities." He emphasized that agencies have "no special competence in resolving statutory ambiguities. Courts do."

- **Overall tendency**: Gorsuch is deeply committed to textualism and originalism. He would closely scrutinize whether "regulate importation" in its ordinary, original meaning includes imposing tariffs. The argument's citation to Chief Justice Marshall and Justice Story would be highly relevant to his analysis. He is skeptical of broad executive power claims not clearly authorized by statute.

---

### Kavanaugh, J.:
- **Loper Bright (2024)**: Majority (listed as author, joining Roberts's opinion). Kavanaugh fully endorsed the framework requiring courts to independently interpret statutes and determine the "best reading" using traditional tools.

- **Overall tendency**: Kavanaugh favors clear textual interpretation and has shown interest in historical context. He would examine the ordinary meaning of "regulate" at the time IEEPA was enacted and whether imposing tariffs falls within that meaning. He tends to be methodical in applying interpretive canons.

---

### Barrett, J.:
- **Loper Bright (2024)**: Majority (listed as author, joining Roberts's opinion). Barrett joined the majority overruling Chevron. She has written and spoken extensively about textualism and the importance of ordinary meaning in statutory interpretation.

- **Overall tendency**: Barrett is a committed textualist who would focus on the ordinary meaning of "regulate importation" in IEEPA. She would consider whether historical understanding and usage support including tariffs within that phrase. Her approach emphasizes that text must be read in context and that semantic meaning controls.

---

### Jackson, J.:
- **Loper Bright (2024)**: Unknown/partial participation. Justice Jackson recused from No. 22-451 but participated in No. 22-1219. She joined the Kagan/Sotomayor dissent as it applied to that case, indicating support for Chevron deference.

- **Overall tendency**: Based on her joining the dissent, Jackson appears more deferential to agency statutory interpretations. She would likely give weight to the executive's reading of "regulate importation" as encompassing tariffs, though she would still engage with the textual arguments.

---

## PREDICTION NOTES

**Strengths of this argument:**
1. The historical evidence is substantial—Marshall's *Gibbons* opinion, Madison's writings, and Story's commentaries all support the view that "regulating commerce" includes imposing duties.
2. *McGoldrick v. Gulf Oil* directly states that "laying a duty on imports is also an exercise of the power to regulate foreign commerce."
3. Post-*Loper Bright*, courts must use traditional tools including historical understanding—this argument aligns well with that methodology.

**Weaknesses/Counterarguments:**
1. The textualist justices (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett, Kavanaugh, Thomas) will focus on IEEPA's specific text, not just general commerce clause principles. The question is what "regulate importation" means *in IEEPA*, not what "regulate commerce" meant in 1824.
2. The statutory context of IEEPA—enacted against the backdrop of Tariff Act provisions—may suggest Congress distinguished between "regulation" and "tariff imposition."
3. The *noscitur a sociis* canon (words known by their companions) may limit "regulate" based on the other authorities granted in IEEPA.

**Likely Justice Breakdown:**
- **Favorable to argument**: Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson (likely to accept executive interpretation)
- **Skeptical but engaged**: Roberts, Kavanaugh (will examine historical evidence carefully but may find it insufficient for IEEPA specifically)
- **Most skeptical**: Gorsuch, Thomas, Barrett (strict textualists who will demand close alignment between historical evidence and IEEPA's actual language)
- **Unpredictable**: Alito (pragmatic, could go either way)

**Key consideration**: The justices will likely focus on whether the Founding-era understanding of "regulate commerce" including tariffs translates to IEEPA's specific phrase "regulate importation"—a different textual question that requires examining IEEPA's structure and purpose.

## ARG-R02

**RESPONDENT:** Congress ratified the interpretation that 'regulate importation' includes tariffs when it reenacted TWEA language in IEEPA after the Yoshida decision upheld Nixon's tariffs.

# Justice Position Analysis: ARG-R02

## ARGUMENT: ARG-R02 - Congressional Ratification Through Reenactment

**Summary:** Congress ratified the interpretation that 'regulate importation' includes tariffs when it reenacted TWEA language in IEEPA after the Yoshida decision upheld Nixon's tariffs.

**Core Legal Issue:** This argument invokes the congressional ratification doctrine—the principle that when Congress reenacts statutory language after courts have given it a particular construction, Congress is presumed to have adopted that construction. The respondent argues that since Congress enacted IEEPA in 1977 using the same "regulate importation" language from TWEA, and did so with knowledge of Yoshida (1975) which upheld Nixon's tariffs under that language, Congress ratified the interpretation that the phrase includes tariff authority.

---

## RELEVANT CASE ANALYSIS

### LOPER BRIGHT ENTERPRISES v. RAIMONDO (2024)

**Relevance to ARG-R02:** While Loper Bright primarily addresses Chevron deference, it contains significant discussion of statutory interpretation methodology, congressional intent, and how courts should approach questions of what Congress "knew" or "intended" when enacting legislation. The case's treatment of interpretive presumptions is directly relevant to evaluating the congressional ratification doctrine.

---

## JUSTICE POSITION SUMMARIES

### Roberts, C.J.
- **Loper Bright (2024):** Majority (author). Chief Justice Roberts authored the majority opinion overruling Chevron. On statutory interpretation methodology relevant to ARG-R02, he emphasized: "Courts interpret statutes, no matter the context, based on the traditional tools of statutory construction, not individual policy preferences." He rejected the fiction that statutory ambiguity necessarily reflects congressional intent to delegate authority. Critically, Roberts distinguished between actual legislative history evidence and presumptions about what Congress "must have intended," stating that "a statutory ambiguity does not necessarily reflect a congressional intent" and that "[m]any or perhaps most statutory ambiguities may be unintentional."

- **Overall tendency:** Roberts favors rigorous statutory interpretation over broad presumptions about congressional intent. He is skeptical of interpretive shortcuts that assume Congress intended particular meanings without concrete evidence. However, the congressional ratification doctrine is a traditional canon of construction (unlike Chevron deference), so Roberts would likely apply it if properly supported—but would scrutinize whether Congress actually "adopted" an interpretation versus merely reenacted language without focused attention on the issue.

---

### Thomas, J.
- **Loper Bright (2024):** Concurrence (concurring opinion). Justice Thomas joined the majority and wrote separately to emphasize historical and constitutional foundations. He stressed that "[t]he Framers anticipated that courts would often confront statutory ambiguities and expected that courts would resolve them by exercising independent legal judgment." Thomas's concurrence emphasizes originalist interpretive methodology and skepticism of presumptions that concentrate power in the executive branch.

- **Overall tendency:** Thomas strongly favors textualism and original understanding. He would likely scrutinize the congressional ratification argument carefully, looking for concrete evidence that Congress actually considered and adopted Yoshida's interpretation, rather than accepting a presumption. His skepticism of executive power expansion suggests he would be critical of using the ratification doctrine to expand presidential tariff authority beyond clear statutory text.

---

### Alito, J.
- **Loper Bright (2024):** Majority (noted as "author" but this appears to be a data error; Alito joined the Roberts majority). Justice Alito joined Chief Justice Roberts's opinion without writing separately.

- **Overall tendency:** By joining the Loper Bright majority, Alito endorsed rigorous independent judicial interpretation of statutes and skepticism of presumptions about congressional intent. He would likely apply the congressional ratification doctrine as a traditional canon but would examine whether the specific conditions for ratification are met.

---

### Sotomayor, J.
- **Loper Bright (2024):** Dissent (author). Justice Sotomayor dissented, joined by Kagan and (in part) Jackson. Her dissent defended Chevron's presumption that Congress intends agencies to resolve statutory ambiguities, arguing that "Congress may generally expect resolution [of ambiguities] by the agency." She emphasized the legitimacy of presumptions about congressional intent based on statutory structure and context.

- **Overall tendency:** Sotomayor is more willing to accept presumptions about congressional intent and to defer to agency/executive interpretations of ambiguous statutes. She would likely be receptive to the congressional ratification argument, viewing Congress's reenactment of TWEA language in IEEPA with awareness of Yoshida as meaningful evidence of intent to preserve tariff authority.

---

### Kagan, J.
- **Loper Bright (2024):** Dissent (concurring in dissent). Justice Kagan joined Sotomayor's dissent. Her approach to statutory interpretation generally accepts that Congress legislates against the backdrop of judicial interpretations and that reenactment can signal adoption of existing constructions.

- **Overall tendency:** Kagan embraces pragmatic statutory interpretation and is comfortable with presumptions about congressional awareness and intent. She would likely find the congressional ratification argument persuasive, particularly given the House Report's citation to Yoshida.

---

### Gorsuch, J.
- **Loper Bright (2024):** Concurrence (concurring opinion). Justice Gorsuch wrote a substantial concurrence emphasizing separation of powers and the dangers of executive aggrandizement through statutory interpretation. He wrote: "The very point of the traditional tools of statutory construction is to resolve statutory ambiguities"—not to defer to executive branch claims of power. He stressed that courts must independently determine statutory meaning, especially "when the ambiguity is about the scope of an agency's own power—perhaps the occasion on which abdication in favor of the agency is least appropriate."

- **Overall tendency:** Gorsuch is deeply skeptical of interpretive doctrines that expand executive power. While he respects traditional interpretive canons, his Loper Bright concurrence suggests he would closely scrutinize a congressional ratification argument that expands presidential authority. He would likely demand clear evidence that Congress specifically considered and adopted Yoshida's tariff interpretation, rather than accepting a generalized presumption. His emphasis on limiting executive power where "ambiguity is about the scope of an agency's own power" suggests resistance to broad readings of IEEPA authority.

---

### Kavanaugh, J.
- **Loper Bright (2024):** Majority (noted as "author" but joined Roberts's majority opinion). Justice Kavanaugh joined the majority and his approach generally favors clear statutory text over interpretive presumptions. He has written elsewhere about separation of powers concerns with expansive executive authority.

- **Overall tendency:** Kavanaugh's alignment with the Loper Bright majority suggests he would apply traditional interpretive tools rigorously. He would likely examine whether Congress specifically focused on the tariff interpretation in Yoshida when enacting IEEPA, rather than accepting a blanket presumption of ratification. His administrative law jurisprudence shows concern about executive overreach.

---

### Barrett, J.
- **Loper Bright (2024):** Majority (noted as "author" but joined Roberts's majority opinion). Justice Barrett joined the majority. Her textualist approach emphasizes close reading of statutory text and careful attention to legislative process.

- **Overall tendency:** Barrett would likely take a rigorous approach to the congressional ratification doctrine, looking for specific evidence that Congress focused on and adopted the tariff interpretation. Her textualism suggests she would examine whether the House Report's citation to Yoshida indicates specific congressional focus on tariff authority or merely a general reference to TWEA precedent.

---

### Jackson, J.
- **Loper Bright (2024):** Unknown (recused from No. 22-451; joined dissent as to No. 22-1219). Justice Jackson joined the Kagan/Sotomayor dissent in the Relentless case, indicating alignment with their interpretive approach.

- **Overall tendency:** Based on her partial participation in Loper Bright, Jackson appears receptive to presumptions about congressional intent and would likely be sympathetic to the congressional ratification argument.

---

## PREDICTION NOTES

**Strengths of ARG-R02:**
- The congressional ratification doctrine is a traditional, well-established canon of construction—unlike Chevron deference, which the conservative justices just overruled
- The House Report's specific citation to Yoshida provides concrete evidence (not mere presumption) that Congress was aware of the tariff interpretation
- The doctrine serves the separation of powers by recognizing Congress's legislative supremacy in defining statutory meaning

**Weaknesses/Challenges:**
- Loper Bright's majority expressed skepticism of presumptions about what Congress "must have intended"
- Gorsuch's concurrence specifically warned against interpretive doctrines that expand executive power over its "own" authority
- The conservative majority may demand evidence that Congress specifically focused on tariff authority (not just general awareness of Yoshida) before finding ratification
- The ratification doctrine is strongest when Congress reenacts identical language to address the same situation—here, IEEPA was enacted for different emergency contexts than TWEA

**Likely Justice Alignments:**

*More likely to accept ratification argument:*
- Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson (receptive to congressional intent presumptions)

*Skeptical but may accept if well-supported:*
- Roberts, Alito, Kavanaugh, Barrett (will examine evidence carefully)

*Most skeptical:*
- Thomas, Gorsuch (strong textualists; concerned about executive power expansion)

**Key Questions the Justices May Ask:**
1. Did Congress specifically consider tariff authority when enacting IEEPA, or was Yoshida cited merely as one example of TWEA usage?
2. Does reenacting "regulate importation" in a new statute (IEEPA) necessarily adopt all prior interpretations, or only those directly relevant to the new statute's purposes?
3. Is there evidence Congress rejected alternative language that would have excluded tariff authority?
4. Did the House Report's citation to Yoshida indicate adoption of its tariff holding, or merely acknowledgment of TWEA precedent generally?

# JUSTICE POSITION ANALYSIS

## ARGUMENT: ARG-R04 - The Major Questions Doctrine is inapplicable in the foreign affairs context where the President has inherent Article II authority and Congress deliberately grants broad emergency powers.

---

## JUSTICE POSITION SUMMARY

### Roberts, C.J.:
- **American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi (2003)**: Did not participate (joined Court in 2005)
- **Free Enterprise Fund (2010)**: Majority (author). Authored opinion emphasizing the President must be able to oversee executive officers and take care that laws are faithfully executed. Focused on presidential accountability through removal power.
- **NLRB v. Noel Canning (2014)**: Special concurrence. Joined Scalia's narrower interpretation of recess appointments power, suggesting restraint in expanding executive authority absent clear textual support.
- **Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015)**: Dissent. Argued Congress has significant powers in foreign affairs alongside President; rejected broad "exclusive" presidential recognition power, emphasizing shared powers model.
- **Trump v. Hawaii (2018)**: Majority (author). Strongly deferred to executive in immigration/national security context, finding President's actions within broad statutory delegation; noted "the admission and exclusion of foreign nationals is a 'fundamental sovereign attribute'" largely immune from judicial control.
- **Seila Law v. CFPB (2020)**: Majority (author). Emphasized President's removal power derives from "executive Power" vested in Article II; resistant to structures that insulate executive officers from presidential control.
- **Trump v. Mazars (2020)**: Majority (author). Emphasized separation of powers concerns and need for balance between branches; noted historical practice of inter-branch negotiation.
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Majority (author). Confirmed FHFA Director structure unconstitutional; reaffirmed presidential removal authority.
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Majority (author). Officers exercising significant authority must be supervised by principal officers; President must be accountable for executive actions.
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Majority (author). Applied major questions doctrine to EPA's Clean Power Plan; required "clear congressional authorization" for agency claims of vast authority with "economic and political significance."
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Majority (author). Applied major questions doctrine to student loan forgiveness; emphasized "basic and consequential tradeoffs" must come from Congress.

**Overall tendency**: Roberts has strongly enforced major questions doctrine domestically but has shown significant deference to executive authority in foreign affairs/national security contexts (Trump v. Hawaii). His dissent in Zivotofsky suggests he doesn't view presidential foreign affairs power as unlimited. However, his application of MQD focuses on domestic regulatory agencies claiming "transformative" authority—foreign affairs deference may create separate track.

---

### Thomas, J.:
- **American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi (2003)**: Dissent (author). Challenged broad executive preemption of state law in foreign affairs; argued for stronger limits on executive authority even in foreign relations.
- **Free Enterprise Fund (2010)**: Majority (author listed incorrectly in data; he joined majority). Supported strong presidential control over executive officers.
- **NLRB v. Noel Canning (2014)**: Special concurrence (author). Took narrowest view of recess appointments—only inter-session recesses; emphasizes textual limitations on executive power.
- **Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015)**: Special concurrence (partial dissent). Acknowledged President's recognition power but took narrower view, arguing Congress has more authority than majority recognized. Wrote: foreign affairs power is not "a blanket power."
- **Trump v. Hawaii (2018)**: Concurrence. Joined majority but wrote separately to question nationwide injunctions.
- **Seila Law v. CFPB (2020)**: Concurrence. Would have gone further than majority in invalidating the CFPB structure.
- **Trump v. Mazars (2020)**: Dissent. Would have provided even more protection for President from congressional subpoenas.
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Concurrence. Agreed with unconstitutionality; would limit Humphrey's Executor further.
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Dissent. Would not have found Appointments Clause violation; shows some restraint in limiting executive structures.
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Majority (author listed incorrectly; he joined). Supports strong nondelegation/major questions principles.
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Majority (author listed incorrectly; he joined). Supports major questions doctrine application.

**Overall tendency**: Thomas supports strong limits on executive agencies through nondelegation but is skeptical of unlimited presidential foreign affairs power. His Garamendi dissent and Zivotofsky concurrence show he would not automatically exempt foreign affairs from constitutional constraints. He might apply MQD principles even in foreign affairs context.

---

### Alito, J.:
- **Free Enterprise Fund (2010)**: Majority (author listed incorrectly; joined majority). Supports presidential control over executive officers.
- **NLRB v. Noel Canning (2014)**: Special concurrence (author). Joined narrow interpretation of recess appointments; favors textual limits on executive authority.
- **Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015)**: Dissent (author). Argued Congress has substantial authority in foreign affairs; rejected sweeping executive recognition power. Wrote Congress's power over passports was established.
- **Trump v. Hawaii (2018)**: Majority (author listed incorrectly; joined majority). Supported deference to executive in immigration/national security.
- **Seila Law v. CFPB (2020)**: Majority (author listed incorrectly; joined majority). Supports presidential removal power.
- **Trump v. Mazars (2020)**: Dissent. Would provide stronger protection for executive from congressional oversight.
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Majority (joined). Supports executive accountability principles.
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Majority (author listed incorrectly; joined majority). Supports principal officer supervision requirements.
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Concurrence (author). Wrote separately to emphasize major questions doctrine's foundations.
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Majority (author listed incorrectly; joined). Supports MQD application.

**Overall tendency**: Alito has shown skepticism of claims of exclusive presidential foreign affairs authority (Zivotofsky dissent) while deferring to executive in national security contexts (Trump v. Hawaii). His strong MQD support may extend to questioning whether foreign affairs context exempts executive from clear congressional authorization requirements.

---

### Sotomayor, J.:
- **Free Enterprise Fund (2010)**: Dissent (author). Would have upheld dual for-cause removal protections; favors congressional flexibility in structuring agencies.
- **NLRB v. Noel Canning (2014)**: Majority (joined). Supported broader executive recess appointment authority.
- **Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015)**: Majority (joined). Supported President's exclusive recognition power.
- **Trump v. Hawaii (2018)**: Dissent (joined). Strongly opposed deference to executive; emphasized need to scrutinize pretextual justifications.
- **Seila Law v. CFPB (2020)**: Dissent (author). Would uphold congressional restrictions on executive removal; emphasizes congressional authority to structure agencies.
- **Trump v. Mazars (2020)**: Majority (joined). Balanced approach to separation of powers.
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Dissent (joined). Would uphold single-director removal protection.
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Dissent (author). Would reject strict principal officer requirements; favors congressional flexibility.
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Dissent (author). Strongly opposes major questions doctrine; views it as judicial overreach limiting congressional delegations.
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Dissent (author). Continues opposition to MQD; argues it rewrites clear statutes.

**Overall tendency**: Sotomayor opposes the major questions doctrine generally and supports broad congressional delegation authority. She would likely accept the argument that foreign affairs context warrants different treatment, but from the perspective that MQD shouldn't apply anywhere, not from executive power grounds.

---

### Kagan, J.:
- **Free Enterprise Fund (2010)**: Did not participate (joined Court in 2010 after argument)
- **NLRB v. Noel Canning (2014)**: Majority (author). Supported practical, historically-grounded executive authority; emphasized governmental practice over strict textualism.
- **Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015)**: Majority (joined). Supported exclusive presidential recognition authority.
- **Trump v. Hawaii (2018)**: Dissent (author). Would apply more searching review to executive immigration actions.
- **Seila Law v. CFPB (2020)**: Dissent (joined). Supports congressional flexibility in agency structure.
- **Trump v. Mazars (2020)**: Majority (joined). Supported balanced separation of powers approach.
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Special concurrence (wrote separately on severability but agreed on merits).
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Dissent (author). Would not impose strict supervision requirements; favors congressional agency-design choices.
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Dissent (joined). Strongly opposes major questions doctrine.
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Dissent (joined). Continues MQD opposition.

**Overall tendency**: Kagan opposes MQD but favors practical, functional approaches to separation of powers. Her NLRB v. Noel Canning opinion emphasized historical practice and accommodation between branches. She would likely be sympathetic to arguments about foreign affairs requiring flexibility.

---

### Gorsuch, J.:
- **Trump v. Hawaii (2018)**: Majority (author listed incorrectly; joined majority). Supported deference to executive in national security/immigration.
- **Seila Law v. CFPB (2020)**: Concurrence (author). Took strong view of presidential removal power; emphasizes original understanding.
- **Trump v. Mazars (2020)**: Majority (joined). Supported balanced separation of powers analysis.
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Concurrence (joined Thomas). Would limit independent agencies further.
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Concurrence (partial dissent). Would have gone further in requiring principal officer supervision.
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Concurrence (author). Wrote extensively on major questions doctrine's constitutional foundations; connects to nondelegation concerns.
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Majority (joined). Supports strong MQD.

**Overall tendency**: Gorsuch is the Court's strongest proponent of nondelegation principles underlying MQD. His West Virginia concurrence argued MQD serves to enforce Article I's vesting of legislative power in Congress. However, his joining Trump v. Hawaii shows deference to executive in national security. The question is whether he views foreign affairs as a different constitutional category.

---

### Kavanaugh, J.:
- **Trump v. Hawaii (2018)**: Did not participate (joined Court after decision)
- **Seila Law v. CFPB (2020)**: Majority (author for severability portion). Supports strong presidential accountability over executive officers.
- **Trump v. Mazars (2020)**: Majority (joined). Supported balanced separation of powers.
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Majority (author for severability portion). Supports executive accountability principles.
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Majority (joined). Supports principal officer supervision.
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Majority (joined). Supports MQD.
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Majority (joined). Supports MQD application.

**Overall tendency**: Kavanaugh has consistently supported both executive accountability and MQD. As a D.C. Circuit judge, he dissented in the CFPB case emphasizing presidential control. He tends to favor clear lines in separation of powers cases. No foreign affairs cases to analyze directly.

---

### Barrett, J.:
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Majority (author for portions). Supports presidential accountability.
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Majority (joined). Supports principal officer requirements.
- **West Virginia v. EPA (2022)**: Majority (joined). Supports MQD.
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Concurrence (author). Wrote separately to explain MQD methodology; characterized it as context-specific statutory interpretation tool.

**Overall tendency**: Barrett supports MQD but her Biden v. Nebraska concurrence emphasized MQD is a "tool of statutory interpretation" applied in context. This suggests she may apply MQD flexibly based on circumstances, which could cut either way regarding foreign affairs.

---

### Jackson, J.:
- **Biden v. Nebraska (2023)**: Dissent (author). Wrote separately opposing MQD; argued it lacks constitutional foundation and allows judges to override clear congressional intent.

**Overall tendency**: Jackson opposes MQD. Only one relevant case to analyze. She would likely be receptive to arguments limiting MQD's application generally.

---

## PREDICTION NOTES

**Arguments favoring respondent (MQD inapplicable in foreign affairs):**

1. **Trump v. Hawaii precedent**: Roberts's majority showed extraordinary deference to executive in foreign affairs/national security, finding broad statutory delegation appropriate. The 5-4 conservative majority specifically distinguished domestic regulatory cases.

2. **Zivotofsky recognition of presidential foreign affairs authority**: Even where Congress has competing authority, Court recognized "the Nation must speak with one voice" in foreign affairs (quoting Garamendi).

3. **Historical foreign affairs deference**: Unlike domestic agencies claiming novel regulatory authority, IEEPA represents decades of accepted emergency powers usage, fitting Youngstown Zone 1.

4. **Gorsuch's distinction**: His MQD opinions focus on agencies exercising "legislative" powers Congress shouldn't have delegated—but tariffs are traditionally executive/foreign affairs measures.

**Arguments against respondent (MQD should apply):**

1. **Thomas and Alito's Zivotofsky dissents**: Both questioned unlimited presidential foreign affairs authority and emphasized congressional role.

2. **Scale and economic significance**: West Virginia and Biden v. Nebraska emphasized "economic and political significance" triggers MQD regardless of context. Billions in tariff costs may qualify.

3. **Barrett's contextual approach**: Her Biden concurrence suggests MQD turns on whether Congress would have spoken clearly if contemplating this application—perhaps IEEPA's authors didn't contemplate permanent peacetime tariff regimes.

4. **No foreign affairs MQD precedent cuts both ways**: Court hasn't applied MQD in foreign affairs, but also hasn't exempted it.

**Likely alignment:**

- **Likely accepting foreign affairs exception**: Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson (oppose MQD generally); possibly Roberts, Kavanaugh (support foreign affairs deference)
- **Skeptical of blanket exception**: Thomas, Alito (skeptical of unlimited executive foreign affairs power); Gorsuch (strong MQD proponent); Barrett (contextual approach)
- **Swing consideration**: Whether tariffs are "traditional" executive foreign affairs authority or unprecedented domestic economic regulation dressed as foreign affairs

**RESPONDENT:** The nondelegation doctrine has little or no force in foreign affairs where the President has inherent Article II authority and Congress may delegate broadly.

# Justice Position Analysis: ARG-R07

## ARGUMENT ANALYZED

**Argument ID:** ARG-R07
**Side:** RESPONDENT
**Summary:** The nondelegation doctrine has little or no force in foreign affairs where the President has inherent Article II authority and Congress may delegate broadly.

**Detail:** This Court has repeatedly held that strict limitations on domestic delegations do not apply in foreign affairs. Congress must 'paint with a broader brush' given unpredictable foreign contingencies. The President is the constitutional actor in foreign affairs and Congress supplements, not creates, his authority. IEEPA provides adequate standards through its emergency declaration requirements, time limits, exceptions, and congressional oversight.

---

## JUSTICE POSITION SUMMARY

### Roberts, C.J.:
- **American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi (2003)**: Did not participate (joined Court in 2005)
- **Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB (2010)**: Majority (author). Emphasized the constitutional importance of executive accountability and the President's Article II responsibility to "take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed." Stressed that executive power must flow through a "clear and effective chain of command" from the President.
- **NLRB v. Noel Canning (2014)**: Special concurrence (joined Scalia's opinion concurring in judgment). Favored a more restrictive, originalist reading of executive power under the Recess Appointments Clause, rejecting the majority's functionalist approach that gave weight to historical executive practice.
- **Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015)**: Dissent (author, joined by Alito). Argued against exclusive presidential recognition power, emphasizing that Congress has substantial authority in foreign affairs. Rejected the notion that the President holds exclusive power over recognition, arguing this "takes a myopic view of the powers of Congress." Noted the Constitution gives Congress numerous foreign affairs powers.
- **Gundy v. United States (2019)**: Dissent (joined Gorsuch). Signaled willingness to reconsider and strengthen nondelegation doctrine. Joined opinion arguing for more rigorous enforcement of limits on congressional delegation.
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Majority (author). Reaffirmed principles of executive accountability and presidential oversight of executive branch officers.
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Majority (author of Parts I and II). Emphasized that executive power requires supervision by principal officers accountable to the President; decisions must be reviewable by Senate-confirmed officials.

**Overall tendency:** Roberts has shown skepticism toward broad executive power claims when they conflict with congressional authority. In Zivotofsky, he specifically rejected expansive readings of exclusive presidential foreign affairs power. He has also joined opinions favoring stricter nondelegation enforcement. While he supports executive accountability structures, he does not appear to endorse a categorical foreign affairs exception to normal separation of powers principles.

---

### Thomas, J.:
- **American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi (2003)**: Dissent (joined Ginsburg's dissent). Rejected broad foreign affairs preemption doctrine; argued against expansive executive branch power to preempt state law absent clear congressional authorization.
- **Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB (2010)**: Majority (joined). Supported strong executive accountability requirements.
- **NLRB v. Noel Canning (2014)**: Special concurrence (author). Advocated for originalist interpretation limiting executive power; rejected functionalist justifications based on historical practice. Argued the majority's approach "sweeps away key textual limitations on the recess-appointment power."
- **Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015)**: Special concurrence (concurring in judgment in part, dissenting in part). Took a distinctive position on residual executive power. Argued the President has some inherent foreign affairs powers but emphasized textual limits. Distinguished between powers textually committed to the President and those where Congress has authority.
- **Gundy v. United States (2019)**: Dissent (author, joined by Gorsuch). Wrote separately to argue for "reconsideration of our approach to the delegation of legislative power." Argued the Constitution vests legislative power exclusively in Congress and this must be enforced without exception.
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Concurrence. Wrote to emphasize limits on independent agencies.
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Dissent (author of Parts I and II, joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, Kagan). Argued against the majority's approach to the Appointments Clause remedy; showed concern about judicial overreach into structural constitutional matters.

**Overall tendency:** Thomas has been the Court's most vocal advocate for reinvigorating the nondelegation doctrine, explicitly calling for reconsideration of permissive precedents. He does not appear to embrace a categorical foreign affairs exception. His originalist methodology would likely require clear textual or historical support for any relaxed delegation standards in foreign affairs, which he has not endorsed.

---

### Alito, J.:
- **Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB (2010)**: Majority (author per opinion notes, though Roberts authored; Alito joined majority). Supported executive accountability principles.
- **NLRB v. Noel Canning (2014)**: Special concurrence (joined Scalia's opinion). Favored restrictive, originalist interpretation of executive power claims.
- **Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015)**: Dissent (author). Strongly rejected exclusive presidential recognition power. Wrote: "The Constitution does not make the President the sole repository of whatever power the United States may have under international law." Emphasized Congress's broad foreign commerce and other enumerated powers affecting foreign relations. Argued the majority's approach improperly aggrandizes executive power.
- **Gundy v. United States (2019)**: Special concurrence (author). Stated: "If a majority of this Court were willing to reconsider the approach we have taken for the past 84 years [on nondelegation], I would support that effort." Explicitly signaled willingness to strengthen nondelegation doctrine.
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Majority (joined).
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Majority (joined Parts I, II, and III). Supported requirement for principal officer review of executive adjudications.

**Overall tendency:** Alito has been consistently skeptical of broad executive power claims in foreign affairs. His Zivotofsky dissent directly challenges the premise that the President has exclusive or plenary foreign affairs authority. He has explicitly stated willingness to strengthen nondelegation doctrine, suggesting he would not embrace a foreign affairs exception. He appears likely to reject the argument that nondelegation has "little or no force" in foreign affairs.

---

### Sotomayor, J.:
- **Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB (2010)**: Dissent (author). Argued the majority's approach to executive removal was too rigid and formalistic. Expressed comfort with congressional structuring of executive agencies that departs from unitary executive theory.
- **NLRB v. Noel Canning (2014)**: Majority (joined). Endorsed functionalist approach to separation of powers, giving weight to historical practice and practical governmental needs.
- **Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015)**: Majority (joined). Supported recognizing exclusive presidential recognition power based on functional considerations and historical practice in foreign affairs.
- **Gundy v. United States (2019)**: Majority (joined plurality). Supported permissive "intelligible principle" approach to nondelegation; rejected calls to strengthen the doctrine.
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Dissent (concurred in part). Argued against rigid application of removal restrictions doctrine.
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Dissent (joined Breyer's opinion; also joined Thomas's dissent as to Parts I and II). Argued against formalistic approach to Appointments Clause requirements.

**Overall tendency:** Sotomayor consistently favors functionalist approaches to separation of powers questions, giving weight to practical governmental needs and historical practice. She joined the Zivotofsky majority recognizing broad presidential foreign affairs power and defended the permissive nondelegation standard in Gundy. She would likely be receptive to the argument that foreign affairs delegations warrant deference.

---

### Kagan, J.:
- **Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB (2010)**: Did not participate (recused).
- **NLRB v. Noel Canning (2014)**: Majority (joined). Supported functionalist interpretation of presidential power, emphasizing historical practice and practical needs of government.
- **Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015)**: Majority (joined). Supported exclusive presidential recognition power in foreign affairs based on functional considerations.
- **Gundy v. United States (2019)**: Judgment (concurring in plurality reasoning). Author of plurality opinion defending the permissive "intelligible principle" test. Wrote that Congress need only "lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle" and the nondelegation doctrine gives "Congress a great deal of flexibility in filling up the details."
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Special concurrence. Expressed skepticism of broad removal restriction doctrines.
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Dissent (joined Breyer's opinion). Favored functionalist approach to Appointments Clause.

**Overall tendency:** Kagan is the author of the most recent defense of permissive delegation standards (Gundy plurality). She favors functionalist approaches and has joined opinions recognizing broad presidential foreign affairs authority. She would likely be highly receptive to the argument that nondelegation should be relaxed in foreign affairs, and that IEEPA's standards are adequate.

---

### Gorsuch, J.:
- **Gundy v. United States (2019)**: Dissent (author, joined by Roberts and Thomas). Wrote the most comprehensive modern opinion calling for reinvigoration of the nondelegation doctrine. Argued: "Congress may not transfer to another branch 'powers which are strictly and exclusively legislative.'" Emphasized the Framers' insistence on legislative accountability for policy decisions restricting liberty. Did NOT endorse any foreign affairs exception; instead, suggested that even Curtiss-Wright's broad language about foreign affairs discretion may be limited to powers "already within the scope of executive power" under Article II.
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Concurrence. Emphasized limits on congressional structuring of executive agencies.
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Concurrence in part, dissent in part. Emphasized importance of accountability in executive decision-making; would have provided broader remedy.

**Overall tendency:** Gorsuch is the leading voice for strengthening nondelegation doctrine. His Gundy dissent specifically addressed the foreign affairs question, suggesting that the President's inherent Article II powers (not congressional delegation) explain permissible executive discretion in foreign affairs. This would distinguish between Congress delegating its own legislative power (impermissible) and Congress recognizing executive power that already exists under Article II (permissible). He would likely scrutinize whether tariff authority is truly an inherent executive power or a delegated legislative power.

---

### Kavanaugh, J.:
- **Gundy v. United States (2019)**: Did not participate (took no part in decision).
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Majority (author per circuit opinion noting his role). Supported executive accountability principles.
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Majority (joined Parts I, II, and III). Emphasized importance of accountability through review by Senate-confirmed officers.

**Note:** As a D.C. Circuit judge, Kavanaugh authored the dissent in Free Enterprise Fund (below), arguing the PCAOB structure violated separation of powers—a position the Supreme Court later adopted. His academic writings and lower court opinions suggest sympathy for nondelegation concerns. However, he has not yet written extensively on foreign affairs delegation at the Supreme Court level.

**Overall tendency:** Limited Supreme Court record on this precise issue, but his structural separation of powers jurisprudence emphasizes accountability. His views on foreign affairs delegation specifically remain uncertain, though he has not endorsed categorical exceptions to separation of powers principles.

---

### Barrett, J.:
- **Collins v. Yellen (2021)**: Majority (joined). Supported executive accountability principles.
- **United States v. Arthrex (2021)**: Majority (joined Parts I, II, and III). Supported requirement for principal officer review.

**Overall tendency:** Barrett's record on this specific issue is limited. She joined majority opinions emphasizing executive accountability and oversight requirements. As an academic, she wrote favorably about originalist approaches to separation of powers. Her views on foreign affairs delegation specifically are not yet established in her Supreme Court opinions.

---

## PREDICTION NOTES

**Justices Likely to REJECT the Argument (that nondelegation has little force in foreign affairs):**

1. **Gorsuch** - His Gundy dissent specifically addresses and limits the foreign affairs exception, suggesting broad delegation is only permissible for powers already within Article II executive authority, not delegated legislative power. He would likely argue tariff-setting is a congressional power being delegated, not an inherent executive power.

2. **Thomas** - Has explicitly called for reconsideration of permissive nondelegation standards and shows no indication of endorsing a foreign affairs exception. His originalist methodology would demand textual or historical support for such an exception.

3. **Alito** - Explicitly willing to strengthen nondelegation; his Zivotofsky dissent directly rejects the premise that the President has exclusive or plenary foreign affairs authority. Argued Congress has substantial constitutional powers affecting foreign relations.

4. **Roberts** - Joined Gorsuch's Gundy dissent; his Zivotofsky dissent rejected exclusive presidential foreign affairs power. Would likely be skeptical of categorical foreign affairs exception to nondelegation.

**Justices Likely to ACCEPT the Argument:**

1. **Kagan** - Author of Gundy plurality defending permissive delegation; joined Zivotofsky majority recognizing broad presidential foreign affairs power. Most likely to accept both the permissive nondelegation standard and a foreign affairs exception.

2. **Sotomayor** - Consistent functionalist; joined both Gundy plurality and Zivotofsky majority. Would likely defer to Congress's judgment that broad delegation is appropriate in foreign affairs.

**Uncertain:**

1. **Kavanaugh** - Structural separation of powers concerns but limited record on foreign affairs delegation specifically. His vote may depend on whether tariffs are characterized as inherent executive foreign affairs authority or delegated legislative power.

2. **Barrett** - Insufficient record to predict. Her originalist inclinations may cut against a foreign affairs exception, but she has not addressed this question.

**Key Analytical Point:**

The argument's success may turn on whether the Court views tariff authority as:
(a) An inherent Article II executive power in foreign affairs (which Congress merely "supplements"), or
(b) A delegated Article I congressional power (regulation of foreign commerce) that must satisfy nondelegation requirements.

Gorsuch's Gundy dissent suggests this distinction is crucial. If tariffs are legislative power being delegated, the foreign affairs context may not excuse the delegation. If they are executive power Congress is merely recognizing, broader discretion may be permitted.

# Justice Position Analysis: ARG-R09

**ARGUMENT:** ARG-R09 - The President's determinations that trade deficits and drug trafficking constitute 'unusual and extraordinary threats' warranting emergency action are essentially unreviewable.

---

## JUSTICE POSITION SUMMARY

### Roberts, C.J.:

**Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015):** Dissent (joined Scalia's dissenting opinion). Roberts dissented from the majority's recognition of exclusive presidential power over recognition, arguing that Congress has significant authority over foreign affairs. He emphasized that "the Constitution does not give the President unfettered authority over foreign affairs" and that §214(d) did not impermissibly intrude on executive power. Roberts wrote separately to note that "[t]o the extent the Constitution confers power on the President to recognize foreign states or governments, I see no basis for concluding that it is an exclusive power."

**Trump v. Hawaii (2018):** Majority (author). Roberts authored the opinion upholding the travel ban, applying highly deferential review to the President's national security determinations. Key language: "The admission and exclusion of foreign nationals is a 'fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government's political departments largely immune from judicial control.'" He applied rational basis review and found the Proclamation "expressly premised on legitimate purposes" with findings reflecting "the results of a worldwide review process undertaken by multiple Cabinet officials and their agencies." The Court stated it "cannot substitute its own assessment for the Executive's predictive judgments on such matters."

**Overall tendency:** Roberts shows a tension between skepticism of exclusive executive power claims (Zivotofsky dissent) and strong deference to executive national security/immigration determinations (Trump v. Hawaii). The key distinction may be whether Congress has spoken: in Zivotofsky, Congress acted and Roberts defended congressional power; in Trump v. Hawaii, Roberts deferred to broad statutory delegation (§1182(f)).

---

### Thomas, J.:

**Dalton v. Specter (1994):** Majority (author). Thomas authored the opinion holding that presidential actions under the Base Closure Act were not reviewable under the APA. Key holding: "How the President chooses to exercise the discretion Congress has granted him is not a matter for our review." He emphasized that when the President exercises discretionary authority granted by statute, "there is no law to apply" for courts to review compliance with "the statutory mandate."

**American Insurance Assn. v. Garamendi (2003):** Dissent (joined Ginsburg's dissent). Thomas dissented from the Court's broad interpretation of executive foreign affairs preemption, expressing skepticism about implied presidential powers displacing state law.

**Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015):** Concurrence in part/dissent in part. Thomas concurred in the judgment that the President has exclusive recognition power but wrote separately with a distinct analytical framework emphasizing residual executive power over foreign affairs. He argued that "the President has a functional (not a substantive) power to implement the Government's recognition policy."

**Trump v. Hawaii (2018):** Concurrence (joined majority). Thomas joined Roberts' deferential opinion and wrote separately to emphasize limits on nationwide injunctions, not to question the deference owed to presidential national security determinations.

**Overall tendency:** Thomas consistently supports broad executive discretion in foreign affairs and national security, with a textual/originalist framework. His Dalton opinion is particularly relevant—holding that discretionary presidential determinations are essentially unreviewable. However, he is skeptical of implied preemption powers (Garamendi).

---

### Alito, J.:

**Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015):** Dissent (author). Alito argued vigorously that Congress has substantial power over foreign affairs and that §214(d) was constitutional. He wrote: "In the end, the Constitution may well permit Congress to legislate on [recognition-related] subjects without the President's consent... The notion that the Constitution gives the President exclusive power over recognition is not established by the text or the Constitution's structure."

**Trump v. Hawaii (2018):** Majority (joined). Alito joined Roberts' highly deferential opinion upholding the travel ban based on national security justifications.

**Overall tendency:** Alito defends congressional authority in foreign affairs (Zivotofsky) while also supporting deference to executive national security determinations when operating under broad statutory delegations (Trump v. Hawaii). Like Roberts, the key appears to be whether Congress has acted or acquiesced.

---

### Sotomayor, J.:

**Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015):** Majority (joined Kennedy's opinion). Sotomayor joined the majority recognizing exclusive presidential recognition power, though the opinion emphasized this was a narrow holding about one specific power.

**Trump v. Hawaii (2018):** Dissent (author of separate dissent). Sotomayor wrote a lengthy dissent arguing the Proclamation was infected by religious animus. She criticized the majority's deferential approach: "The majority here completely sets aside the President's charged statements about Muslims as combatants in the war on terrorism." She argued for more searching judicial review of the President's stated rationales.

**Overall tendency:** Sotomayor accepts executive primacy in narrow foreign affairs contexts (recognition) but strongly opposes highly deferential review of presidential national security claims, particularly when there is evidence of improper motive. She would likely scrutinize whether "unusual and extraordinary threat" findings are pretextual.

---

### Kagan, J.:

**Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015):** Majority (joined Kennedy's opinion). Kagan joined the opinion recognizing exclusive presidential recognition power as a narrow, specific holding.

**Trump v. Hawaii (2018):** Dissent (joined Breyer's dissent). Kagan joined the more moderate dissent focusing on the waiver program's operation rather than writing separately on the standard of review, but her vote indicates skepticism of purely deferential review of presidential national security determinations.

**Overall tendency:** Kagan recognizes presidential primacy in specific foreign affairs contexts but appears to favor more meaningful review of national security claims than the highly deferential standard applied in Trump v. Hawaii.

---

### Gorsuch, J.:

**Trump v. Hawaii (2018):** Majority (joined). Gorsuch joined Roberts' deferential opinion. He also joined Thomas's concurrence criticizing nationwide injunctions but did not write separately on the standard of review for presidential determinations.

**Overall tendency:** Limited data, but Gorsuch's vote in Trump v. Hawaii suggests acceptance of substantial deference to executive national security determinations operating under broad statutory authority.

---

### Kavanaugh, J.:
**No participation in relevant cases** (joined Court in 2018 after Trump v. Hawaii was decided).

---

### Barrett, J.:
**No participation in relevant cases** (joined Court in 2020).

---

### Jackson, J.:
**No participation in relevant cases** (joined Court in 2022).

---

## PREDICTION NOTES

**Factors favoring the Respondent's argument (unreviewability):**

1. **Trump v. Hawaii precedent:** Five current justices (Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, plus Kennedy—now replaced by Kavanaugh) applied highly deferential review to presidential national security determinations under §1182(f). The Court emphasized that "the admission and exclusion of foreign nationals is a 'fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government's political departments largely immune from judicial control.'"

2. **Dalton v. Specter framework:** Thomas's opinion establishes that when Congress grants the President discretion (here, IEEPA's "unusual and extraordinary threat" determination), courts cannot second-guess how he exercises it because "there is no law to apply."

3. **Foreign affairs/national security nexus:** Curtiss-Wright (cited extensively) and the consistent thread in these cases treats presidential foreign affairs judgments as receiving maximum deference.

**Factors potentially limiting unreviewability:**

1. **Major Questions Doctrine:** The conservative justices' recent embrace of this doctrine may create tension with pure unreviewability—if the tariffs raise major questions, courts might be more willing to examine whether the threat finding supports the action taken.

2. **Statutory constraints vs. constitutional discretion:** Thomas in Dalton distinguished between constitutional review (available) and statutory compliance review (unavailable for discretionary determinations). If IEEPA's "unusual and extraordinary threat" requirement is seen as a substantive statutory constraint rather than a discretionary grant, courts might apply some review.

3. **Zivotofsky dissenters:** Roberts, Alito, and Scalia's position in Zivotofsky defending congressional foreign affairs power suggests they may not automatically defer when Congress's own framework appears to constrain the executive.

**Likely outcome:** A majority will probably accept substantial deference to the President's threat determinations while reserving the question of whether any review is available. The Court may distinguish between (a) the "unusual and extraordinary threat" finding itself (likely unreviewable per Trump v. Hawaii/Dalton) and (b) the nexus between that finding and the specific tariff measures adopted (potentially reviewable for arbitrariness). Thomas's framework from Dalton—that discretionary presidential determinations under statutory grants are unreviewable—may be particularly influential.
