## Individual Justice Analyses

---

### Chief Justice John Roberts
**PROBABILITY FOR PETITIONER: 62%**
**CONFIDENCE: Medium**

**Key Factors Favoring Petitioner:**
- Authored West Virginia v. EPA (2022) and Biden v. Nebraska (2023), establishing the modern Major Questions Doctrine framework—the tariffs' unprecedented scope ($3 trillion, tenfold increase) directly trigger his "history and breadth of authority" and "economic and political significance" tests
- Authored Loper Bright (2024), emphasizing courts must find the "best reading" of statutes using traditional tools, skeptical of implicit delegations
- Joined Gorsuch's Gundy dissent signaling willingness to strengthen nondelegation limits
- Dissented in Zivotofsky, rejecting exclusive presidential foreign affairs power

**Key Factors Favoring Government:**
- Authored Trump v. Hawaii (2018) with highly deferential review of presidential national security determinations under broad statutory delegations
- Historically values institutional stability; may hesitate to invalidate major presidential action
- May distinguish foreign affairs/national security context from purely domestic regulatory cases

**Critical Uncertainty:**
- Whether he views tariffs as "foreign affairs" warranting Trump v. Hawaii-style deference or as "major questions" requiring West Virginia-style clear authorization. The economic magnitude may push toward MQD application.

**Reasoning:** Roberts authored the definitive MQD precedents and Loper Bright's textualist methodology. The tariffs' unprecedented scale fits squarely within his MQD framework. However, his Trump v. Hawaii deference creates tension. The key question is categorization—and the record suggests Roberts distinguishes contexts where Congress has clearly delegated foreign affairs authority from contexts where agencies claim novel transformative powers. IEEPA's lack of tariff-specific language likely pushes him toward the petitioner.

### Justice Clarence Thomas
**PROBABILITY FOR PETITIONER: 72%**
**CONFIDENCE: Medium-High**

**Key Factors Favoring Petitioner:**
- Most aggressive advocate for reinvigorating nondelegation doctrine (Gundy dissent, calling for "reconsideration" of permissive standards)
- Authored Cochise Consultancy establishing that statutory phrases must have "fixed meaning"—the chameleon argument (regulate can't mean tax for imports but not exports) aligns with his methodology
- Dissented in Garamendi, skeptical of broad executive foreign affairs preemption
- Originalist approach would scrutinize whether "regulate" historically encompassed taxing authority

**Key Factors Favoring Government:**
- Authored Dalton v. Specter establishing presidential discretionary determinations are unreviewable—could apply to threat findings
- Has recognized executive primacy in foreign affairs (Zivotofsky concurrence)
- Strong textualist may accept government's historical argument about "regulate commerce" including tariffs

**Critical Uncertainty:**
- How he weighs the textual consistency principle (regulate can't be a chameleon) against historical evidence that "regulate commerce" included duties. His originalist methodology could cut either way.

**Reasoning:** Thomas's consistent push to strengthen nondelegation doctrine and his explicit refusal to endorse a foreign affairs exception (Gundy) strongly suggest skepticism of IEEPA tariff authority. His Cochise opinion's emphasis on consistent statutory meaning supports the petitioner's chameleon argument. While his Dalton framework might shield threat findings from review, the broader statutory interpretation question—whether IEEPA authorizes tariffs at all—remains subject to his textualist scrutiny.

### Justice Samuel Alito
**PROBABILITY FOR PETITIONER: 65%**
**CONFIDENCE: Medium**

**Key Factors Favoring Petitioner:**
- Explicitly stated in Gundy concurrence: "If a majority of this Court were willing to reconsider the approach we have taken for the past 84 years [on nondelegation], I would support that effort"
- Authored Zivotofsky dissent vigorously rejecting exclusive presidential foreign affairs power and defending congressional authority
- Joined West Virginia v. EPA and Biden v. Nebraska majorities applying MQD
- Joined Loper Bright majority endorsing independent judicial statutory interpretation

**Key Factors Favoring Government:**
- Joined Trump v. Hawaii majority deferring to presidential national security determinations
- Generally pragmatic; may weigh practical consequences of invalidating tariffs
- Yates v. United States: concurred narrowly, didn't fully embrace noscitur a sociis reasoning

**Critical Uncertainty:**
- His pragmatic streak may lead to unpredictable weighting of factors. His strong Zivotofsky dissent defending congressional power against executive overreach is a powerful indicator, but Trump v. Hawaii shows he accepts deference in security contexts.

**Reasoning:** Alito's combination of MQD support and explicit willingness to strengthen nondelegation, plus his aggressive Zivotofsky dissent rejecting unlimited executive foreign affairs authority, positions him favorably for the petitioner. The tariffs' unprecedented nature and the weak textual basis for tariff authority under IEEPA likely trigger his concerns about executive overreach into congressional territory.

### Justice Sonia Sotomayor
**PROBABILITY FOR PETITIONER: 25%**
**CONFIDENCE: Medium-High**

**Key Factors Favoring Petitioner:**
- Dissented in Trump v. Hawaii, arguing for more searching judicial review of presidential national security claims
- May view the tariffs as pretextual (trade deficits as "emergency" strains credibility)
- Joined Yates plurality using noscitur a sociis to narrow broad terms

**Key Factors Favoring Government:**
- Authored Gundy plurality defending permissive "intelligible principle" delegation standard
- Authored West Virginia and Biden v. Nebraska dissents, strongly opposing MQD as "judicial overreach"
- Generally favors functionalist deference to executive in foreign affairs
- Her opposition to MQD is categorical, not limited to domestic contexts

**Critical Uncertainty:**
- Whether her Trump v. Hawaii dissent's suspicion of pretextual national security rationales extends to these tariff proclamations. Her MQD opposition likely outweighs textual arguments.

**Reasoning:** Sotomayor is the Court's strongest opponent of the Major Questions Doctrine, viewing it as illegitimate judicial policymaking. While she might be skeptical of the emergency declarations as pretextual, her functionalist approach and consistent deference to executive branch interpretations of statutory authority strongly favor the government. She would likely view "regulate importation" as reasonably encompassing tariffs.

---

### Justice Elena Kagan
**PROBABILITY FOR PETITIONER: 28%**
**CONFIDENCE: Medium**

**Key Factors Favoring Petitioner:**
- Dissented in Trump v. Hawaii, showing some limits to her deference
- Skilled textualist who takes statutory arguments seriously
- May be troubled by the scope and domestic economic impact

**Key Factors Favoring Government:**
- Authored Gundy plurality defending permissive delegation
- Joined West Virginia and Biden v. Nebraska dissents opposing MQD
- Favors practical, functionalist approaches to separation of powers
- Joined Yates dissent rejecting noscitur a sociis to narrow clear text (though "regulate" is arguably less clear than "tangible object")

**Critical Uncertainty:**
- Her textualist instincts could engage with the strong textual arguments, but her categorical opposition to MQD and support for delegation flexibility likely control.

**Reasoning:** Kagan's opposition to the Major Questions Doctrine is principled and consistent. She authored the Gundy plurality defending broad delegation and dissented in both major MQD cases. While she engages seriously with textual arguments, she would likely view "regulate importation" as reasonably including tariffs and reject the application of MQD to foreign affairs emergency powers. Her Yates dissent shows she's skeptical of using surrounding-word canons to override plausible textual meanings.

### Justice Neil Gorsuch
**PROBABILITY FOR PETITIONER: 78%**
**CONFIDENCE: High**

**Key Factors Favoring Petitioner:**
- Authored the comprehensive Gundy dissent—the most detailed modern articulation of nondelegation principles—explicitly limiting foreign affairs exception to powers "already within the scope of executive power"
- Authored West Virginia v. EPA concurrence elaborating MQD's theoretical foundations, connecting it to nondelegation concerns
- Loper Bright concurrence emphasized agencies cannot discover "new powers in old statutes"
- Strong textualist who would closely examine whether "regulate" includes taxing authority

**Key Factors Favoring Government:**
- Joined Trump v. Hawaii majority
- Has acknowledged some presidential primacy in foreign affairs

**Critical Uncertainty:**
- His Gundy framework distinguishes inherent executive power from delegated legislative power—tariff-setting is constitutionally a congressional power (Article I, Section 8), which he would likely view as requiring clear delegation, not discoverable in "regulate importation."

**Reasoning:** Gorsuch is the intellectual leader on both MQD and nondelegation doctrine. His Gundy dissent specifically addresses the foreign affairs exception, limiting it to inherent Article II powers—tariff authority is Article I congressional power, not inherent executive authority. His Loper Bright concurrence warned against agencies discovering novel powers. The combination of his textualism, nondelegation skepticism, and explicit rejection of a categorical foreign affairs exception makes him a near-certain vote for the petitioner.

### Justice Brett Kavanaugh
**PROBABILITY FOR PETITIONER: 60%**
**CONFIDENCE: Medium-Low**

**Key Factors Favoring Petitioner:**
- Joined West Virginia v. EPA and Biden v. Nebraska majorities applying MQD
- Joined Loper Bright majority
- As D.C. Circuit judge, emphasized separation of powers and presidential accountability structures
- Generally favors clear lines in statutory interpretation

**Key Factors Favoring Government:**
- No participation in Gundy (recused), so his nondelegation views are less clear
- No participation in Trump v. Hawaii, so foreign affairs deference position unknown
- Limited record on foreign affairs separation of powers specifically

**Critical Uncertainty:**
- The most uncertain of the conservative justices due to limited record on the specific intersection of foreign affairs, nondelegation, and MQD. His consistent support for MQD in domestic cases suggests he'd apply it here, but foreign affairs context might change his calculus.

**Reasoning:** Kavanaugh's consistent votes for MQD application and his general separation of powers concerns suggest support for the petitioner. However, his limited foreign affairs jurisprudence creates genuine uncertainty. The tariffs' domestic economic impact and unprecedented scope likely push him toward applying MQD, but he might be more deferential to presidential emergency determinations than Gorsuch or Thomas.

---

### Justice Amy Coney Barrett
**PROBABILITY FOR PETITIONER: 58%**
**CONFIDENCE: Medium-Low**

**Key Factors Favoring Petitioner:**
- Joined West Virginia v. EPA and Biden v. Nebraska
- Strong textualist who would scrutinize "regulate" carefully
- Biden v. Nebraska concurrence characterized MQD as contextual interpretive tool—the IEEPA context (no prior tariff use, surrounding verbs, economic magnitude) could trigger it

**Key Factors Favoring Government:**
- Biden v. Nebraska concurrence suggested MQD should be applied cautiously, within traditional interpretation
- No record on foreign affairs deference questions
- Her contextual approach might distinguish emergency foreign affairs powers

**Critical Uncertainty:**
- Her Biden v. Nebraska concurrence trying to cabin MQD theoretically could cut either way—she might view foreign affairs as a context where MQD operates differently, or she might find the massive economic impact and novel assertion triggers clear statement requirements.

**Reasoning:** Barrett's textualism and MQD support suggest sympathy for the petitioner, but her effort to cabin MQD's theoretical scope creates uncertainty. Her contextual approach might accept that emergency foreign affairs delegations warrant different treatment. However, the complete absence of historical tariff claims under IEEPA and the transformative economic impact likely satisfy her framework for triggering heightened scrutiny.

### Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson
**PROBABILITY FOR PETITIONER: 22%**
**CONFIDENCE: Medium**

**Key Factors Favoring Petitioner:**
- Joined partial dissent in Loper Bright, showing some limits to her deference
- May be skeptical of pretextual emergency declarations

**Key Factors Favoring Government:**
- Authored Biden v. Nebraska dissent opposing MQD, arguing it "lacks constitutional foundation"
- Joined Kagan/Sotomayor's approach in Loper Bright defending agency deference
- Limited record but consistently aligned with liberal bloc on separation of powers

**Critical Uncertainty:**
- Very limited record, but her opposition to MQD in Biden v. Nebraska was strong and categorical.

**Reasoning:** Jackson's Biden v. Nebraska dissent opposing MQD provides the clearest signal—she views the doctrine as judicial overreach that substitutes judges' policy preferences for statutory text. With only limited cases to analyze, her alignment with Sotomayor and Kagan on administrative law questions strongly predicts a vote for the government.

## OVERALL CASE ASSESSMENT

This case presents the Supreme Court with a significant clash between two of its recent doctrinal commitments: the Major Questions Doctrine (West Virginia v. EPA, Biden v. Nebraska) and foreign affairs deference (Trump v. Hawaii). The petitioner's strongest arguments are textual and structural—the six conservative justices' embrace of rigorous statutory interpretation post-Loper Bright, combined with the complete absence of tariff authority claims under IEEPA for nearly 50 years, creates substantial headwinds for the government. The petitioner's "chameleon" argument (regulate can't mean tax for imports but not exports) directly invokes Thomas's Cochise opinion requiring consistent statutory meaning.

The government's best arguments invoke foreign affairs exceptionalism and congressional ratification through reenactment. However, the conservative majority has shown limited appetite for categorical foreign affairs exceptions to separation of powers principles—Gorsuch's Gundy dissent explicitly limited any exception to inherent Article II powers, and tariff-setting is quintessentially Article I authority. The 50-year absence of prior tariff claims makes the congressional ratification argument weaker than typical reenactment cases, where courts presume Congress adopted a clear judicial interpretation.

The most significant uncertainty is whether the six-justice MQD majority will apply the doctrine in the foreign affairs context. The factors they've identified as triggering MQD—unprecedented assertion of authority, vast economic significance, discovery of novel power in old statute—are all present here. Trump v. Hawaii's extreme deference involved a statute (§1182(f)) with clear exclusion authority and facially legitimate national security rationales; IEEPA's "regulate importation" language is far more attenuated from tariff authority, and the "trade deficit" emergency strains credibility.

**Prediction:** The Court will likely rule for the petitioner in a 6-3 or 5-4 decision. The majority will hold that IEEPA's authorization to "regulate importation" does not include authority to impose tariffs, applying the Major Questions Doctrine to require clear congressional authorization for such economically significant power. Roberts will likely author, synthesizing his MQD precedents with Loper Bright's textualism. Gorsuch may write concurrently connecting the ruling to nondelegation concerns. The liberal justices will dissent, arguing MQD should not apply in foreign affairs and that "regulate" reasonably encompasses tariffs as a traditional regulatory tool.
